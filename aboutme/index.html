    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img alt="Image of me?" src="images/myimage.jpg"  />
    <h2>My name is Scott Winkler (like the fonz)</h2>
    <h2>I also go by nicknames Zondreix (zahn-drey-ix) or Jiorgesfrokschte (ee-yor-gez-frok-sch-teh)</h2>
    <p> I have recently completed PathwayConnect. I have worked in the pest control industry for almost 15 years.
        I have been computer savvy with a mechanical aptitude since I was young which has led me to pursue a degree in Applied Technology. 
        I am now working from home as a business development rep which puts me in front of a screen full time.</p>
    
    <p>In the Church along with my wife Juliana, I am currently a Sunday school teacher for the 11-12 year oldâ€™s. 
        I live in the Nampa, Idaho area. I became active in the church a little over a year ago, I have 2 daughters, Lilybell is 9 years old and Nyomi is 2.</p>
    
    <p>My favorite scripture is Helaman 3:35 "They did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, 
       unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God. Fasting and prayer have been a literal source of strength for me, as it reminds me to always embrace humility.</p>     
    
    <p>I have had many hobbies over the years, from playing instruments like piano and guitar, playing sports like racquetball, and spending time outdoors fishing. currently, I enjoy spending my free time playing disc golf and Dungeons and Dragons with my friends.</p>
