                <h2>How can Programmed 2 Sell help me? </h2>
                <p>        Communication is the exchange of expressions, thoughts, ideas, and effective 
                    communication is done by applying sales principles. We will teach you how to 
                    approach someone, how to ask questions that uncover needs, and how to listen and 
                    respond effectively to objections and concerns, how to close the conversation for 
                    a desirable outcome. We will give you a way to practice and receive feedback by 
                    roleplaying with AI, built with a large variety of characters, personalities, and 
                    scenarios.<br/><br/>

                    Example lesson topics:

                    Learn how and why to show empathy with methods like the “feel, felt, found” method, 
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    used when someone expresses a concern, you will practice phrases like “I understand 
                    how you feel, I have felt that way before, here is what I found…” <br/><br/>
            
                    Learn how to read and listen to people to identify what types of responses you need 
                    to follow with, for example, concerns are often come across as complete rejections, 
                    when really, they are just concerns that needs clarification to understand. When 
                    you rephrase a concern whether you understood it or not, you show that you care

                    and are really trying to listen. Showing that you care builds rapport and allows 
                    the conversation to keep going. <br/><br/>

                    Practice!

                    After you have learned what to say and why to say it, then you will engage in 
                    roleplay with AI to practice what you have learned. You’ll practice with a multitude 
                    of personalities from timid and shy to powerful and intimidating. You’ll be exposed 
                    to numerous ways a conversation can go and practice them until you feel confident 
                    that you can handle more scenarios than you can’t.
