                <p> One of my sales reps was really dragging his feet, I didn’t know how to help him, 
                    while the rest of my team was meeting their quotas, he was falling far behind. 
                    I didn’t want to give up on him, so I got him connected with P2S. In 2 weeks, his 
                    numbers started to improve, after a month and a half, he was outperforming some of 
                    his teammates, we recognized him in our last sales meeting for his progression.

                <p>I was being bullied by this person at school, and I got tired of not knowing how 
                    to respond, I would just shut down and not say anything. P2S equipped me with the 
                    confidence to say something because it taught me how to communicate in a way that 
                    not only got them to stop bullying me, but even changed their mind about me,

                <p> My teenage son’s grades were dropping and he was spending too much time playing 
                    video games. P2S taught me how to communicate with him to get him anxiously engaged 
                    in the more important things in life.
