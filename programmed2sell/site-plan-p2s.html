      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been in a situation where you just don’t know how to relate or know what to say?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us enter adulthood not knowing how to effectively communicate or having any sort of social skill whatsoever. 
        When we recognized our struggle we turned to books to learn, but it has taken years for us to master what the books taught. 
        My aim is to speed learning process up, through practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine regularly pitching to the world's most intimidating audiences, my software would simulate that through AI-backed roleplay simulation.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Imagine developing and honing your listening, and responding persuasively skills to the point of verbal muscle memory so precise that you never say "uhm" again.

        You know when you have a great idea, but it gets shut down because you failed to 
        communicate it across to someone?

        Everyone has felt this way at one time or another, and some of us feel stuck 
        and don’t know how to get past it. Many of us see the opportunity to be influential 
        everywhere around us but don’t see ourselves excelling in this, even though we want 
        to. We look back on their past and feel defeated when we remember the social 
        interactions that led to our most awkward moments and us feeling like a deer in the 
        headlights. We keep asking ourselves the questions that we partially know the answer 
        to, like “why does everyone like that person instead of me?”, “Why don’t I have any 
        influence with people?” or “Why do I always feel unheard or unimportant?” We ask why 
        but know that it’s largely because of our underdeveloped social skills. We not only 
        want to know what to say and how to say it, but we also want a safe place to practice
        saying it and gaining feedback to build up our confidence before trying it out in 
        the real world.

        How can Programmed 2 Sell help me? 

        Communication is the exchange of expressions, thoughts, ideas, and effective 
        communication is done by applying sales principles. We will teach you how to 
        approach someone, how to ask questions that uncover needs, and how to listen and 
        respond effectively to objections and concerns, how to close the conversation for 
        a desirable outcome. We will give you a way to practice and receive feedback by 
        roleplaying with AI, built with a large variety of characters, personalities, and 
        scenarios.

        Example lesson topics:

        Learn how and why to show empathy with methods like the “feel, felt, found” method, 
        used when someone expresses a concern, they’ll practice phrases like “I understand 
        how you feel, I’ve felt that way before, here is what I found…” 

        Learn how to read and listen to people to identify what types of responses you need 
        to follow with, for example, concerns are often come across as complete rejections, 
        when really, they’re just concerns that needs clarification to understand. When 
        you'rephrase a concern whether you understood it or not, you show that you care 
        and are really trying to listen. Showing that you care builds rapport and allows 
        the conversation to keep going. 

        Practice!

        After you have learned what to say and why to say it, then you will engage in 
        roleplay with AI to practice what you have learned. You’ll practice with a multitude 
        of personalities from timid and shy to powerful and intimidating. You’ll be exposed 
        to numerous ways a conversation can go and practice them until you feel confident 
        that you can handle more scenarios than you can’t.

        everyone can learn and apply to live their best life. This is for the people who

      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
        I was being bullied by this person at school, and I got tired of not knowing how 
        to respond, I would just shut down and not say anything. P2S equipped me with the 
        confidence to say something because it taught me how to communicate in a way that 
        not only got them to stop bullying me, but even changed their mind about me, 
        starting a friendship I enjoy 
        – 10th grade student

        My teenage son’s grades were dropping and he was spending too much time playing 
        video games. P2S taught me how to communicate with him to get him anxiously engaged 
        in the more important things in life. 
        – a mother

        One of my sales reps was really dragging his feet, I didn’t know how to help him, 
        while the rest of my team was meeting their quotas, he was falling far behind. 
        I didn’t want to give up on him, so I got him connected with P2S. In 2 weeks, his 
        numbers started to improve, after a month and a half, he was outperforming some of 
        his teammates, we recognized him in our last sales meeting for his progression.
